More trains - Less cars



This project is to study the National Household Travel Survey and get information that we need to prove certain factors:

1. There are more cars bought by people in areas that don't have access to train facilities.

2. More people in the Medium income groups make trips more than the higher or lower income groups on cars; which would not be the case if there are access to trains. 

3. Higher number of cars bought by the medium income people who don't have train access.



The reason I did this analysis is because the no. of cars per person in Provo is highest than any other city in the US. And this is the reason why the pollution is also the highest than majority of the cities in the US.

By encouraging an increase in train infrastructure and having train transport access, we can lower this rate in the future.
